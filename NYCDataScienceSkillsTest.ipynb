    "You work for a real estate development company that is trying to determine the perimeter of a lake. The company is planning to split up the land around the lake into different properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you examine the lake, you notice that a particular oddity manifests. From an aerial view, the lake shore looks smooth like a curve. However, as you zoom in and take a closer look you notice that the lake shore has ridges and nooks. If you walk around the lake, you see that the ridges and nooks have smaller ridges and nooks of their own (see picture).\n",

    "Formulate a discussion that addresses this issue and propose a method that would best approximate the perimeter of the lake:"

    "I assume we would be working from some sort of arial photo that is taken from more or less straight above such that the shore is visible (not blocked with trees as in the  photo shown in the prompt).  What I would begin doing is attempting to adjust the photo give the most realistic measurements of the lake.  This means for any angle at which the phtoto was taken we could account for it with an affine transform, if the angle at which the picture was taken is known that is easy enough.  If we know the lens and there is an associated distortion with it we would transform the image to undo this and get most realistic geometery. If these things exist but are unknown, it would be more difficult and I would need to learn more about estimating unknown lens aberations and affine transforms. From there, I would would create a binary mask of the lake, it may be useful to apply some sort of edge-preseving smoothing such as a bilateral filter if there is enough noise to create problems in the mask creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would then fit either a polygon or some sort of curve like a spline to the binary mask.  As stated in the question, the more you zoom in, the more you ridges and nooks that you see.  This means that the more polygon verticies that we allow or the more knots in the spline we allow, the more of these small features that will be fit.  I assume that the company developing the area doesn't care too much about the small features and are instead more interested in lake-front footage when divying up the properties. If we allow too many knots or verticies, the lake will be over-fit for what they are interested in. if we use to few, it will be poorly fit and inaccurate. Similar to determining model for graphical data fits, we could fit for a range of different knots or verticies and used something equivalent to reduced R-squared or baysean information criterion that not only measures goodness of fit but penalizes for number of model parameters, in this case, the number of knots of verticies.  Once the optimal number is chosen, we should be able to easily estimate the perimeter."
